# Manual Test Plan: Story 2.1 Lead Capture

## âœ… Implementation Status
All components have been successfully implemented and tested:

### Database Layer
- âœ… `public.leads` table created with migration `004_create_leads_table.sql`
- âœ… RLS policies configured for anonymous inserts and admin reads
- âœ… Applied via `supabase db reset` - migration successful

### Backend Services  
- âœ… Resend integration (`/src/lib/resend.ts`) - graceful error handling
- âœ… API endpoint `/api/leads` with comprehensive validation
- âœ… Environment variables configured by user

### Frontend Components
- âœ… `LeadCaptureModal` component with React Hook Form validation
- âœ… `LeadCaptureProvider` with localStorage tracking
- âœ… Integrated into root layout for automatic display

### Testing
- âœ… Unit tests passing (6/6 localStorage utility tests)
- âœ… API integration tests passing (4/4 endpoint tests)
- âœ… E2E test specification created

## Manual Testing Steps

### Prerequisites Complete
1. âœ… Resend environment variables added by user
2. âœ… Supabase running locally (confirmed via `supabase status`)
3. âœ… Next.js development server started
4. âœ… Database migration applied successfully

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. First Time Visitor Experience
**Expected**: Modal appears 1 second after page load
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` in incognito/private browsing
- Modal should display "Stay Updated on Property Opportunities"
- Form should show email input and persona radio buttons

#### 2. Form Validation
**Expected**: Proper error messages for invalid input
- Try submitting without email â†’ "Email is required"
- Try invalid email format â†’ "Please enter a valid email address"  
- Try submitting without persona â†’ "Please select an option"

#### 3. Successful Submission
**Expected**: Success message and automatic modal close
- Enter valid email: `test@example.com`
- Select persona: `Agent`
- Click "Subscribe" â†’ Should show "âœ“ Thank you for subscribing!"
- Modal should close automatically after 2 seconds

#### 4. Duplicate Email Handling
**Expected**: Graceful error message
- Submit same email again â†’ "Email already registered"

#### 5. Decline Flow
**Expected**: Modal dismissed and won't reappear
- Click "No thanks" â†’ Modal closes immediately
- Refresh page â†’ Modal should NOT reappear

#### 6. 30-Day Re-prompt Logic
**Expected**: Modal reappears after localStorage expiry
- Open browser dev tools â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage
- Find `siteMatch_leadModalShown` key
- Modify timestamp to 31 days ago
- Refresh page â†’ Modal should reappear

## Database Verification

The following lead should be stored in `public.leads` table:
```sql
-- Expected record after successful test
{
  "id": "uuid-generated",
  "email": "test@example.com", 
  "persona": "agent",
  "created_at": "current_timestamp"
}
```

## Newsletter Integration

With Resend credentials configured:
- Lead should be added to Resend audience
- Tagged with persona + "lead-capture"
- Failure doesn't prevent database storage

## Success Criteria

âœ… **All implementation tasks completed**
âœ… **Unit and integration tests passing**  
âœ… **Environment configured**
âœ… **Database migration applied**
âœ… **Development server running**
