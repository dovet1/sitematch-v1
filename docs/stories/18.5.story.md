# Story 18.5: Individual Team Member Pages

## Status: Ready

## Story

As a **platform visitor**,
I want **to view individual team member profiles with their details and contact information**,
So that **I can learn about specific agents and connect with them directly**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Agency profile system, team member data
- Technology: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: Similar to FMX team member pages (referenced example)
- Touch points: Agency profiles, contact obfuscation, breadcrumb navigation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Page Access**: Navigate to team member page from agency profile team grid
2. **URL Structure**: `/agents/[agency-slug]/team/[member-slug]` format
3. **Profile Display**:
   - Large headshot (or initials fallback)
   - Full name as heading
   - Job title/role
   - Bio text (if provided)
   - Contact information (email, phone, LinkedIn)
4. **Contact Actions**:
   - Email link triggers `mailto:`
   - Phone link triggers `tel:`
   - LinkedIn opens in new tab
   - Contact info obfuscated for spam prevention
5. **Breadcrumb Navigation**:
   - Home > Agent Directory > [Agency Name] > [Team Member Name]
   - Each segment clickable for navigation
6. **Agency Context**: Show "Part of [Agency Name]" with link back to agency

**Display Requirements:**

7. Responsive layout for mobile/tablet/desktop
8. Graceful handling of missing information
9. 404 for non-existent team members
10. Loading state while fetching data

**SEO Requirements:**

11. Meta tags with team member name and agency
12. Person schema markup (schema.org)
13. Canonical URL
14. noindex for members without bio content

## Technical Notes

**Implementation Approach:**
- Static generation with ISR for SEO
- Email obfuscation using CSS or JavaScript
- Implement breadcrumb schema markup
- Share layout with agency profile pages

**Component Structure:**
```
/app/agents/[slug]/team/[member]/page.tsx - Team member page
/components/agency/TeamMemberProfile.tsx - Profile component
/components/common/Breadcrumbs.tsx - Reusable breadcrumb
/lib/team-member.ts - Data fetching logic
```

**URL Generation:**
```typescript
function generateMemberSlug(name: string): string {
  return name
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/g, '');
}
```

**Contact Obfuscation:**
```typescript
// Email obfuscation to prevent scraping
function obfuscateEmail(email: string): JSX.Element {
  const [user, domain] = email.split('@');
  return (
    <span 
      data-user={user} 
      data-domain={domain}
      className="email-obfuscated"
    />
  );
}
```
