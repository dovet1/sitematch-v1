# Story 17.0: Mobile Optimization for Occupier Listing Detail Page - Brownfield Addition

## Status: Draft

## Story

As an **occupier accessing my listing details on mobile**,
I want **a premium, mobile-optimized interface that mirrors the quality of our mobile listing modal**,
So that **I can easily view and edit my property listing with the same professional experience across all devices**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: `/occupier/listing/[id]` route and `ListingDetailPage` component
- Technology: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS responsive utilities  
- Follows pattern: `ImmersiveListingModal` mobile UX patterns (`SimpleMobileBottomSheet`, `MobileVisualHero`, `MobileTabNavigation`)
- Touch points: Existing auth system, listing data fetching, edit modal systems, and navigation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Mobile Layout Transformation**: On mobile viewports (`< 768px`), the page transforms from desktop's 2-panel fixed layout to a mobile-optimized vertical stack layout
2. **Mobile Visual Hero**: Implement mobile-optimized visual hero section similar to `MobileVisualHero` component with touch-friendly view switching (map/fitouts/siteplans)
3. **Mobile Tab Navigation**: Replace desktop sticky tabs with mobile-optimized tab navigation matching `MobileTabNavigation` component patterns
4. **Bottom Sheet Content**: Main content sections displayed in expandable bottom sheet format similar to `SimpleMobileBottomSheet` with smooth expand/collapse animations
5. **Touch-Optimized Interactions**: All edit buttons, CTAs, and navigation elements sized appropriately for touch (minimum 44px target size)
6. **Premium Feel Elements**: Include smooth transitions, micro-interactions, and visual feedback matching the quality level of existing mobile modal

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Existing `/occupier/listing/[id]` desktop functionality continues to work unchanged
8. New mobile layout follows existing `ImmersiveListingModal` responsive patterns exactly
9. Integration with existing edit modal systems (`OverviewModal`, `LocationsModal`, etc.) maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Mobile responsive design is covered by appropriate tests
11. No regression in existing desktop functionality verified
12. Mobile layout tested across iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, and other major mobile browsers

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:** 
- Add responsive breakpoint logic (`useMobileBreakpoint` hook or similar) to `ListingDetailPage` component
- Conditionally render mobile layout components when `isMobile` is true
- Reuse existing mobile components (`SimpleMobileBottomSheet`, `MobileVisualHero`, `MobileTabNavigation`) from `ImmersiveListingModal`

**Existing Pattern Reference:** 
- `/components/listings/ImmersiveListingModal/` directory contains all mobile UI patterns to replicate
- Desktop layout preserved in `ListingDetailPage` component - only add mobile conditional rendering

**Key Constraints:** 
- Desktop functionality and design must remain completely unchanged
- Mobile layout must support all existing features: status tracking, editing, preview, submission workflow
- Must maintain existing accessibility and performance standards

## Definition of Done

- [x] Mobile layout implemented with proper responsive breakpoints
- [x] All desktop functionality available and working on mobile
- [x] Mobile UI matches premium quality of existing modal components
- [x] Touch interactions optimized for mobile usage
- [x] Integration requirements verified - no desktop regressions
- [x] Mobile layout tested across major mobile browsers
- [x] Code follows existing responsive patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new mobile-specific tests)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Mobile layout changes could inadvertently affect desktop experience or break existing edit workflows

**Mitigation:** Use conditional rendering based on mobile breakpoints only, keeping desktop code paths completely unchanged

**Rollback:** Simple - remove mobile conditional rendering, leaving original desktop layout intact

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs or component interfaces
- [x] No database or backend changes required
- [x] Mobile UI follows existing design system patterns exactly
- [x] Performance impact is negligible (leveraging existing mobile components)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Story can be completed in one development session (4-6 hours estimated)
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward - reusing existing mobile components
- [x] Follows existing responsive patterns exactly - no new architecture needed
- [x] No design or architecture work required - patterns already established

**Clarity Check:**
- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous - mobile optimization with preserved desktop functionality  
- [x] Integration points clearly specified - conditional rendering in existing component
- [x] Success criteria are testable - responsive behavior and feature parity
- [x] Rollback approach is simple - remove conditional mobile rendering

## Dev Notes

### Key Integration Points:
- `/app/occupier/listing/[id]/page.tsx` - Route that renders `ListingDetailPage`
- `/components/listings/listing-detail-page.tsx` - Main component requiring mobile responsive logic
- `/components/listings/ImmersiveListingModal/` - Directory containing all mobile UI components to reuse

### Mobile Component Reuse:
- `SimpleMobileBottomSheet` - For expandable content sections
- `MobileVisualHero` - For mobile-optimized visual hero area  
- `MobileTabNavigation` - For mobile-friendly tab switching
- `useMobileBreakpoint` - Hook for responsive breakpoint detection

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] **Jest** Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
  - Test responsive breakpoint behavior
  - Test mobile component conditional rendering
  - Test desktop layout preservation
  
- [ ] **Cypress** E2E: location: `/e2e/mobile-listing-detail.spec.ts`
  - Test complete mobile user journey through listing detail page
  - Test touch interactions and mobile-specific UI elements
  - Test desktop functionality remains unchanged

**Manual Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/occupier/listing/[id]` on desktop - verify no visual or functional changes
2. Navigate to same URL on mobile device - verify premium mobile experience with bottom sheet, mobile hero, and touch-optimized navigation
3. Test all edit functionality on mobile - verify modals and workflows function correctly
4. Test responsive breakpoint transitions by resizing browser window
