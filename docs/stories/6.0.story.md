## Dev Technical Guidance

### E2E Testing Structure

```typescript
// tests/e2e/user-journeys.spec.ts
describe('MVP User Journeys', () => {
  test('Occupier: Complete listing creation flow', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test signup → wizard → submission → confirmation
  });
  
  test('Admin: Moderation workflow', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test login → queue → approve/reject → notifications
  });
  
  test('Public: Directory search and contact', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test search → filter → view listing → contact info
  });
});
```

### Performance Budgets

```javascript
// lighthouse.config.js
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      numberOfRuns: 3,
    },
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        'categories:performance': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }],
        'categories:accessibility': ['error', { minScore: 0.95 }],
        'categories:best-practices': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }],
        'categories:seo': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }],
      },
    },
  },
};
```
