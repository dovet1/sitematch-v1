# Enhanced Parking Overlay Configuration - Brownfield Addition

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

- As a **commercial property developer or site assessor**
- I want **to configure, rotate, and manage parking overlays with specific bay quantities, row types, and standardized dimensions**
- so that **I can accurately plan and visualize parking capacity for different commercial site layouts with full control over overlay positioning and organization**

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: SiteSketcher mapping tool and existing parking overlay system
- Technology: React, TypeScript, Mapbox GL JS, Turf.js for geometric calculations
- Follows pattern: Existing ParkingOverlay component and parking-calculations utilities
- Touch points: MapboxMap component, ResponsiveControls, parking state management

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Bay Quantity Input**: Users can type a specific number of parking bays (1-100) with input validation
2. **Row Type Selection**: Users can choose between "single row" and "double row" parking layouts via radio buttons
3. **Bay Size Selection**: Users can select between two standardized bay sizes:
   - Standard: 2.7m × 5.0m 
   - Compact: 2.4m × 4.8m
4. **Auto Layout Generation**: Once configured, the system generates and places parking overlays on the map near the last drawn polygon
5. **Visual Feedback**: Configuration shows estimated capacity based on current polygon area
6. **Parking Overlay Rotation**: Users can rotate individual parking overlays using mouse/touch drag on rotation handles, following the same pattern as polygon rotation
7. **Individual Parking Overlay Deletion**: Users can delete specific parking overlays using delete buttons in the sidebar/bottom sheet
8. **Clear All Parking Overlays**: Users can clear all parking overlays at once with confirmation dialog

**Overlay Management Requirements:**

9. **Rotation Consistency**: Parking overlay rotation follows identical patterns to polygon rotation (2° per pixel sensitivity, 15° snap increments)
10. **Deletion Interface**: Delete buttons appear in both desktop sidebar and mobile bottom sheet following existing UI patterns
11. **Selection State**: Selected parking overlays show visual indicators consistent with polygon selection styling
12. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Clear all operations require user confirmation with "This cannot be undone" messaging

**Integration Requirements:**

13. Existing polygon drawing functionality continues to work unchanged
14. New configuration options integrate seamlessly with existing ParkingOverlay component
15. Integration with MapboxMap maintains current overlay rendering and interaction behavior
16. Mobile responsive design follows existing bottom sheet pattern
17. Desktop sidebar integration maintains current layout structure

**Quality Requirements:**

18. Configuration is validated before overlay generation
19. Error handling for invalid configurations or missing polygons
20. State persistence matches existing localStorage pattern for both configuration and rotation states
21. Rotation and deletion operations clean up map sources and event listeners properly
22. No regression in existing measurement and overlay management functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Enhance existing ParkingOverlay component with improved configuration UI
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow current pattern in `/apps/web/src/app/sitesketcher/components/ParkingOverlay.tsx`
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within existing PARKING_SIZES constants and parking-calculations utilities
- **State Management**: Leverage existing SiteSketcherState structure for configuration persistence

## Dev Notes

### Current System Context

The SiteSketcher tool already has a comprehensive parking overlay system with the following components:

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- `/apps/web/src/types/sitesketcher.ts` - Contains ParkingConfiguration and ParkingOverlay interfaces
- `/apps/web/src/app/sitesketcher/components/ParkingOverlay.tsx` - Main UI component for parking configuration
- `/apps/web/src/lib/sitesketcher/parking-calculations.ts` - Utility functions for layout generation and capacity calculation
- `/apps/web/src/app/sitesketcher/page.tsx` - Main page component with state management

**Current Capabilities:**
- Parking overlay type selection (single/double)
- Size selection (standard 2.7x5m, compact 2.4x4.8m) 
- Quantity configuration with +/- buttons and direct input
- Auto layout generation within polygon bounds
- Individual overlay management and rotation
- Mobile responsive design

**Enhancement Areas:**
- The current implementation already supports basic requested functionality but needs enhanced rotation and deletion features
- Bay quantity input exists but could be enhanced for better user experience
- Row type selection maps to existing single/double layer types
- Standardized dimensions already implemented in PARKING_SIZES constant
- **Rotation Enhancement**: Current rotation exists but needs to match polygon rotation UX patterns (handles, snapping, sensitivity)
- **Deletion Enhancement**: Need individual delete buttons and clear all functionality in both desktop sidebar and mobile bottom sheet
- **State Management**: Rotation and deletion state needs to integrate with existing localStorage persistence patterns

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/apps/web/src/app/sitesketcher/components/__tests__/ParkingOverlay.test.tsx`
- [ ] Playwright E2E: location: `/e2e/sitesketcher-parking-enhanced.spec.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
1. Navigate to `/sitesketcher`
2. Draw a polygon on the map
3. Open parking controls panel
4. Configure parking settings:
   - Enter specific number of bays (e.g., 25)
   - Select single or double row
   - Choose between standard (2.7x5m) or compact (2.4x4.8m) bay sizes
5. Click "Auto Layout" to generate parking overlay
6. Verify overlays are placed within polygon bounds
7. **Test Rotation Functionality**:
   - Click on a parking overlay to select it
   - Drag rotation handle to rotate the overlay
   - Verify 15° snapping behavior
   - Confirm rotation updates are saved
8. **Test Deletion Functionality**:
   - Use individual delete buttons in sidebar/bottom sheet
   - Test "Clear All Parking" with confirmation dialog
   - Verify proper state cleanup after deletion
9. Test on mobile device for responsive behavior including new rotation and deletion controls

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met (bay quantity input, row selection, size selection, rotation, deletion)
- [ ] Overlay management requirements verified (rotation consistency, deletion interface, selection state, confirmation dialogs)
- [ ] Integration requirements verified (seamless integration with existing components, responsive design)
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested (polygon drawing, measurements, overlay management)
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards (TypeScript, React best practices, rotation/deletion patterns)
- [ ] Tests pass (unit tests for parking calculations and rotation/deletion, integration tests for component, E2E tests for workflow)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified for all new controls
- [ ] Proper cleanup verified (event listeners, map sources, state management)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable (inline code comments)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Breaking existing parking overlay functionality during enhancement
- **Mitigation**: Incremental changes to existing components, comprehensive regression testing
- **Rollback**: Revert to previous ParkingOverlay component version, existing functionality preserved

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing parking overlay APIs
- [ ] Database changes: None required (client-side only feature)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns (shadcn/ui components, consistent styling)
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (same underlying calculations and rendering)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session (4 hours focused work)
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward (enhancing existing component)
- [ ] Follows existing patterns exactly (ParkingOverlay component pattern)
- [ ] No design or architecture work required (leveraging existing design system)

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous (specific UI elements and behaviors defined)
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified (ParkingOverlay, parking-calculations)
- [ ] Success criteria are testable (manual and automated test scenarios defined)
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple (component-level changes only)
