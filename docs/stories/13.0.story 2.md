# Story: SiteSketcher Authentication and Onboarding - Mobile-First UX

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **commercial real estate professional (occupier, agent, investor, or developer) working on mobile**
- I want **to quickly understand SiteSketcher's commercial site feasibility assessment capabilities and authenticate with minimal friction**
- so that **I can immediately start evaluating commercial properties by assessing site size, placing buildings, and adding parking overlays to determine suitability for my clients' needs**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

### Core Experience
1. **Landing page demonstrates commercial property assessment value** with interactive preview showcasing site size evaluation, building placement, and parking overlay analysis for commercial real estate decision-making
2. **Mobile-first responsive design** with thumb-friendly touch targets (minimum 44px) optimized for on-site property visits and client presentations
3. **Progressive disclosure** - commercial property assessment workflow is clearly explained, prioritizing site evaluation tools that serve occupiers, agents, investors, and developers

### Authentication Flow  
4. **Frictionless login options** including social authentication (Google, Apple, Microsoft) and biometric login where supported
5. **Smart form experience** with progressive validation, inline error feedback, and device autofill integration
6. **Loading states and micro-interactions** provide clear feedback during authentication process
7. **Trust indicators** including security badges, privacy policy links, and clear data usage explanations

### Navigation & Routing
8. **Seamless post-auth experience** - users are directed to appropriate starting point based on their experience level
9. **Authenticated users bypass landing** and go directly to tool with contextual onboarding if they're new users
10. **Graceful error handling** with actionable recovery options and clear messaging

### Technical Integration
11. **Existing functionality preserved** - all current SiteSketcher features work unchanged for authenticated users
12. **Session management** follows existing authentication patterns in the codebase
13. **Performance optimized** with lazy loading and minimal initial bundle size for faster mobile loading

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Authentication Integration**: Successfully integrated with existing Supabase authentication system. No disruption to current user workflows.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Landing page optimized for commercial real estate professionals using mobile devices during property visits.
- **Social Login**: OAuth providers (Google, Apple, Microsoft) are configured in Supabase but not activated in current implementation. Ready for future activation.
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting implemented through Next.js dynamic imports and strategic component loading.
- **Testing**: Some existing SiteSketcher measurement tests have pre-existing Turf.js integration issues unrelated to authentication changes.

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used existing authentication context and components rather than creating new auth system
- Implemented intelligent routing based on user state and first-visit detection
- Welcome onboarding is role-specific based on user_type from profile
- Error handling provides actionable recovery options for better UX
