# Story 11.0: Migrate from Magic Link to Email/Password Authentication

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a platform administrator
- I want to migrate our authentication system from magic links to email/password authentication
- so that users have a more traditional and immediate login experience without needing to check their email

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. All existing magic link authentication components are updated to support email/password authentication
2. New users can sign up with email and password (with password strength requirements)
3. Existing users can log in with email and password after migration
4. Password reset functionality is implemented for users who forget their password
5. All existing SiteMatcher dev team users are migrated to the new authentication method
6. The authentication context and Supabase configuration support password-based authentication
7. Form validation includes password requirements (minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number)
8. Loading states and error messages are updated to reflect password authentication
9. The auth callback route is updated or replaced to handle password authentication flow
10. Session management remains unchanged (users stay logged in as before)
11. All authentication touchpoints in the app use the new password-based approach

## Dev Notes

### Current Authentication Implementation
- Currently using Supabase magic link authentication via `signInWithOtp`
- Auth context located at `/apps/web/src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`
- Main auth components in `/apps/web/src/components/auth/`
- Magic link callback handled at `/apps/web/src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`

### Migration Approach for Existing Users
Since all existing users are SiteMatcher dev team members, we'll use a manual migration approach:
1. Generate temporary passwords for each team member
2. Use Supabase dashboard or admin API to set passwords
3. Communicate new passwords securely to team members
4. Require password change on first login (optional but recommended)

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter  
- At least one number
- Special characters optional but encouraged

### Supabase Password Auth Methods
- Sign up: `supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password })`
- Sign in: `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })`
- Reset: `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email)`
- Update: `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: newPassword })`

### Component Reuse Strategy
- Maintain existing modal structure and styling
- Reuse form components from shadcn/ui
- Keep existing navigation flows intact
- Preserve redirect functionality after login

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest with React Testing Library Integration Tests: location: next to component files
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/auth-migration/password-auth.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Test new user registration with email/password
- Verify password validation shows appropriate errors
- Test login with correct and incorrect passwords
- Test forgot password flow end-to-end
- Verify existing migrated users can log in
- Check that all auth-required pages still work
- Test logout functionality remains unchanged
- Verify session persistence works as before

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Completed Successfully:**
- All authentication components migrated from magic link to email/password
- Password validation implemented with strength requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Supabase configuration updated for password requirements
- Comprehensive password reset flow created
- Build passes successfully with no TypeScript errors

**Deviations from Original Story:**
- Created comprehensive password reset page at `/auth/reset-password` (not originally specified)
- Removed magic-link-form.tsx component entirely instead of updating it
- Auth callback route maintained for password reset flows (emails still use callback)
- Enhanced signup modal completely rewritten for better password UX

**Remaining Work for Next Story:**
- Unit tests for password validation logic
- Integration tests for full auth flow
- E2E test updates for password-based authentication
- Manual testing of existing user migration process
- Performance testing of new auth flows
