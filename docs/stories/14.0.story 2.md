# Story: Individual Toggle Controls for Polygon Measurements

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

- As a SiteSketch user
- I want individual measurement unit and side length display toggles for each polygon
- so that I can view different polygons with their preferred measurement settings simultaneously

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Each polygon card displays two toggle buttons: one for metric/imperial units and one for show/hide side lengths
2. Toggle states are stored per polygon in the polygon's properties object
3. When no polygon-specific setting exists, inherit from global settings
4. Toggle buttons are positioned inline with polygon cards on desktop (right side) and mobile (bottom of card)
5. Existing global toggles in Settings card continue to work as defaults for new polygons
6. Polygon-specific settings persist through localStorage with the polygon data
7. Integration with MapboxDrawPolygon type maintains current behavior
8. Toggle interactions maintain responsive design patterns for mobile/desktop
9. Visual feedback follows existing toggle button patterns
10. No regression in polygon selection, deletion, or measurement display

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Ensure polygon properties with toggle states are saved to localStorage
  - [x] Verify loading restored polygons maintains their individual settings
- [x] Task 6: Update global toggle behavior (AC: 5)
  - [x] Global toggles apply only to new polygons created after change
  - [x] Existing polygons retain their individual settings
  - [x] Add helper text to clarify this behavior in Settings card

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context
- The ResponsiveControls component (/apps/web/src/app/sitesketcher/components/ResponsiveControls.tsx) renders polygon cards in a collapsible measurements section
- Global measurementUnit and showSideLengths are stored in SiteSketcherState
- Polygon data is stored as MapboxDrawPolygon type with properties object
- Current toggle button patterns can be found in Settings card (lines 364-392)

### Key Integration Points
- MapboxDrawPolygon type extension: /apps/web/src/types/sitesketcher.ts
- Polygon card rendering: ResponsiveControls.tsx lines 169-336
- State management: /apps/web/src/app/sitesketcher/page.tsx
- Measurement utilities: /apps/web/src/lib/sitesketcher/measurement-utils.ts

### UX Design Specifications

#### Toggle Button Design
The toggle buttons should follow the existing SiteSketch design patterns for consistency:

**Visual Style:**
- Use the same button styling as Settings card toggles (Button variant="outline" size="sm")
- Height: 32px (h-8 class) on desktop, 44px minimum on mobile for touch targets
- Font: text-xs font-medium
- Default state: bg-background hover:bg-muted border-muted
- Active state for side lengths: bg-blue-50 text-blue-700 border-blue-200 hover:bg-blue-100
- Metric/Imperial toggle: Simple text toggle showing current state ("Metric" or "Imperial")
- Side lengths toggle: Binary state showing "ON" or "OFF"

**Icons (Optional Enhancement):**
- Metric/Imperial: Consider using ruler icon (Ruler from lucide-react) with "m" or "ft" text
- Side lengths: Consider using eye icon (Eye/EyeOff from lucide-react) for show/hide

**Desktop Layout:**
- Position: Right side of polygon card, aligned with delete button
- Layout: Horizontal row with small gap (gap-2) between toggles
- Visibility: Always visible (not just on hover like delete button)
- Container: Add a new div after the area display, before the delete button

**Mobile Layout:**
- Position: Bottom of polygon card, full width
- Layout: Two buttons side by side with equal width (grid grid-cols-2 gap-2)
- Container: Add below the main card content, with padding (p-3)
- Ensure proper touch target sizes (min 44px height)

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Immediate visual feedback on click (no loading states needed)
- Update measurement display instantly when toggled
- Maintain focus states for keyboard navigation
- Use transition-colors for smooth state changes

#### Polygon Card Updates

**Desktop Cards:**
- Maintain existing premium styling with gradient overlays
- Add toggle container that doesn't interfere with selection click area
- Ensure toggles are visually separated from main content area
- Consider subtle divider line between measurement and toggles

**Mobile Cards:**
- Keep compact single-row design for main content
- Add toggle row below main content with clear visual separation
- Use TouchOptimizedButton component for mobile toggles
- Maintain consistent padding and spacing

#### Settings Card Helper Text
Update the Settings card to clarify new behavior:

**Measurement Unit section:**
- Update description to: "Default unit for new polygons (existing polygons keep their settings)"

**Side Length Annotations section:**
- Update description to: "Default visibility for new polygons (existing polygons keep their settings)"

Consider adding a small info icon with tooltip explaining the inheritance behavior.

#### Color Coordination
- Maintain the existing color-coded left border on desktop cards
- Ensure toggle states don't conflict with selection highlighting
- Keep consistent with site's muted color palette (grays, subtle blues)

#### Accessibility Considerations
- Add proper aria-labels for toggle buttons
- Ensure keyboard navigation works within polygon cards
- Maintain focus visibility for all interactive elements
- Consider aria-live region for measurement updates

#### Performance Considerations
- Debounce rapid toggle clicks to prevent excessive re-renders
- Only update affected polygon, not entire list
- Maintain smooth animations under 300ms duration

### Implementation Examples

#### Desktop Toggle Buttons Layout
```tsx
// Inside polygon card, after area display div
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 mt-2">
  <Button
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      handleUnitToggle(polygonId);
    }}
    className="h-8 text-xs font-medium bg-background hover:bg-muted border-muted flex-1"
  >
    {polygonUnit || measurementUnit === 'metric' ? 'Metric' : 'Imperial'}
  </Button>
  <Button
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      handleSideLengthToggle(polygonId);
    }}
    className={cn(
      "h-8 text-xs font-medium transition-colors flex-1",
      polygonShowSides ?? showSideLengths 
        ? "bg-blue-50 text-blue-700 border-blue-200 hover:bg-blue-100" 
        : "bg-background hover:bg-muted border-muted"
    )}
  >
    {polygonShowSides ?? showSideLengths ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
  </Button>
</div>
```

#### Mobile Toggle Buttons Layout
```tsx
// After main mobile card content
<div className="border-t border-muted/60 mt-3 pt-3 px-3 pb-3">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
    <TouchOptimizedButton
      variant="outline"
      size="sm"
      onClick={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        handleUnitToggle(polygonId);
      }}
      className="text-xs font-medium"
      minSize={44}
    >
      {polygonUnit || measurementUnit === 'metric' ? 'Metric' : 'Imperial'}
    </TouchOptimizedButton>
    <TouchOptimizedButton
      variant="outline"
      size="sm"
      onClick={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        handleSideLengthToggle(polygonId);
      }}
      className={cn(
        "text-xs font-medium transition-colors",
        polygonShowSides ?? showSideLengths 
          ? "bg-blue-50 text-blue-700 border-blue-200" 
          : ""
      )}
      minSize={44}
    >
      Sides: {polygonShowSides ?? showSideLengths ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
    </TouchOptimizedButton>
  </div>
</div>
```
