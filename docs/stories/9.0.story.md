# Story 9.0: Company Logo Management with Clearbit Integration

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As an **occupier creating or updating a listing**
- I want **to add my company logo either by entering my company domain (to fetch it automatically via Clearbit) or by uploading my own logo file**
- so that **my listing displays professional branding and attracts potential landlords**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Logo Method Selection Interface**: Protected listing creation/edit form shows two mutually exclusive logo options - "Fetch logo from company domain" (default selected) and "Upload your own logo" with clear radio button selection

2. **Clearbit Logo Fetching (Method 1 - Default)**: When selecting domain method, user can enter valid company domain (e.g., "apple.com"), system validates format, calls Clearbit Logo API, displays loading indicator, shows preview if successful, displays error if failed, and sets `clearbit_logo = true` in database

3. **File Upload Method (Method 2 - Fallback)**: When selecting upload method, user can upload PNG/JPEG/JPG/SVG files up to 2MB, system stores in 'logos' storage bucket, creates file_uploads table record, sets `clearbit_logo = false` in database, and displays image preview

4. **Method Switching**: User can switch between methods, system clears previous selection, shows appropriate UI for new method, and updates `clearbit_logo` field accordingly

5. **Validation and Error Handling**: System validates domain format, handles Clearbit API failures gracefully, enforces file upload constraints, and provides clear error messages for all failure scenarios

6. **Form Persistence and Edit Mode**: Existing listings load with correct method selected and logo displayed, form state persists during editing, and database fields update correctly on save

## Dev Notes

**Current Implementation Context:**
- Logo upload functionality exists in `apps/web/src/components/listings/steps/step1-company-info.tsx` (lines 202-264)
- File upload system available in `apps/web/src/lib/file-upload.ts` and `apps/web/src/components/ui/image-upload.tsx`
- Existing `logoFile`, `logoPreview`, and `logoUrl` fields in wizard state management
- File uploads table configured with logos bucket and proper constraints

**Key Integration Points:**
- Build on existing ImageUpload component functionality
- Leverage current file upload API endpoints and storage system
- Extend existing CompanyInfoData interface in wizard types
- Update enhanced listing submission logic to handle new fields

**Database Schema References:**
- listings table: existing logo_url field, new clearbit_logo and company_domain fields
- file_uploads table: bucket_name='logos', file_type='logo' constraints already exist
- Storage: logos bucket already configured and available

**Clearbit API Details:**
- Free tier: 100 requests/month, no API key required
- URL format: `https://logo.clearbit.com/{domain}`
- Returns image directly or 404 if not found
- Recommend client-side caching for repeated domain lookups

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test: location: next to step1-company-info component
- [ ] Playwright E2E: location: `/e2e/listing-form/logo-management.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Create new listing and test both logo methods with domain validation
- Edit existing listing with Clearbit logo and verify correct method selection
- Edit existing listing with uploaded logo and verify correct method selection  
- Test method switching during form completion
- Verify error handling for invalid domains and failed Clearbit API calls
- Confirm file upload constraints and proper storage bucket usage
- Validate database fields populate correctly for both methods
