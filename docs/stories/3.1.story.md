2. **Enhanced Company Information Step**: Capture complete contact details (name, title, email, phone) and company logo upload
3. **Enhanced Requirement Details Step**: Implement PRD-specified sector options, use class dropdown, and double-thumb slider
4. **Form State Management**: Robust form handling with validation, error states, and data persistence between steps
5. **Protected Route Access**: Authenticated occupiers can access listing creation from protected route (no org_id required)
6. **Auto-Organization Creation**: Automatically create organization from company information during wizard submission
7. **"Violet Bloom" Design System**: Apply the specified color palette, typography, and component styling
8. **Enhanced UI Components**: Implement image upload, range slider, and searchable dropdown components
9. **Responsive Design**: Wizard works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with mobile-first approach
10. **Form Navigation**: Smooth wizard navigation with back/forward controls and step validation

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Wizard Form Specifications

**Step 1: Enhanced Company Information**:
```typescript
interface CompanyInfoData {
  companyName: string; // required
  companyDescription?: string; // optional
  // PRD-required contact fields
  contactName: string; // required
  contactTitle: string; // required
  contactEmail: string; // pre-filled from auth, read-only
  contactPhone?: string; // optional, UK format
  // Company logo
  logoFile?: File; // optional, PNG/JPG/SVG max 2MB
  logoPreview?: string; // base64 preview
}
```

**Step 2: Enhanced Requirement Details**:
```typescript
interface RequirementDetailsData {
  title: string; // required
  description?: string; // optional
  // PRD-specified sector options
  sector: 'retail' | 'food_beverage' | 'leisure' | 'industrial_logistics' | 'office' | 'healthcare' | 'automotive' | 'roadside' | 'other'; // required
  useClassId: string; // required UUID from dropdown selection
  siteSizeMin?: number; // square feet, from double-thumb slider
  siteSizeMax?: number; // square feet, from double-thumb slider
}

// PRD Use Class Options for Dropdown
interface UseClassOption {
  id: string;

  name: string; // E.g., 'Retail', 'General Industrial'
  description: string;
}
```

### Component Architecture

```
/occupier/create-listing/page.tsx (protected route)
└── ListingWizard (container with "Violet Bloom" styling)
    ├── WizardProgress (step indicator)
    ├── Step1CompanyInfo
    │   ├── CompanyDetailsForm
    │   ├── EnhancedContactForm (name, title, email, phone)
    │   └── ImageUpload (company logo)
    └── Step2RequirementDetails
        ├── ListingBasicsForm
        ├── EnhancedSectorSelection (PRD options)
        ├── SearchableDropdown (use class)
        └── RangeSlider (double-thumb site size)
```

### Form State Management

```typescript
// Multi-step form state
interface WizardFormData extends CompanyInfoData, RequirementDetailsData {}

// Step management
interface WizardState {
  currentStep: 1 | 2;
  formData: Partial<WizardFormData>;
  isValid: Record<number, boolean>;
  isSubmitting: boolean;
  organizationCreated?: boolean;
}

// Auto-organization creation
interface OrganizationCreationResult {
  success: boolean;
  organizationId?: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Validation Rules

```typescript
const enhancedValidationSchema = {
  step1: {
    companyName: { required: true, minLength: 2, maxLength: 100 },
    // PRD-required contact fields
    contactName: { required: true, minLength: 2, maxLength: 50 },
    contactTitle: { required: true, minLength: 2, maxLength: 100 },
    contactEmail: { required: true, email: true },
    contactPhone: { phone: true, pattern: /^(\+44|0)[1-9]\d{8,9}$/ }, // UK format
    // Logo validation
    logoFile: { 
      fileType: ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/svg+xml'],
      maxSize: 2048 * 1024 // 2MB
    }
  },
  step2: {
    title: { required: true, minLength: 5, maxLength: 200 },
    sector: { required: true, enum: ['retail', 'food_beverage', 'leisure', 'industrial_logistics', 'office', 'healthcare', 'automotive', 'roadside', 'other'] },
    useClassId: { required: true, uuid: true },
    // Site size cross-validation
    siteSizeMin: { min: 0, max: 10000000 },
    siteSizeMax: { min: 0, max: 10000000, greaterThan: 'siteSizeMin' }
  }
};
```

### Auto-Organization Creation Flow

```typescript
// Submission process with auto-organization creation
async function handleWizardSubmission(formData: WizardFormData) {
  // 1. Create organization from company info
  const orgResult = await createOrganizationFromCompanyInfo({
    name: formData.companyName,
    description: formData.companyDescription,
    type: 'occupier'
  });
  
  // 2. Update user with new org_id
  if (orgResult.success) {
    await updateUserOrganization(userId, orgResult.organizationId);
  }
  
  // 3. Create listing with organization context
  return await createListing(formData, userId, orgResult.organizationId);
}
```
