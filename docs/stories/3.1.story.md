# Story 3.1: Listing Creation Wizard UI Components

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

- As an **authenticated Occupier**
- I want to create property requirement listings through an intuitive multi-step wizard interface
- so that I can easily input my company information and property requirements in a structured way

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Multi-Step Wizard UI**: Implement 2-step listing creation wizard with progress indication and navigation
2. **Company Information Step**: Capture occupier company details with form validation and auto-create organization
3. **Requirement Details Step**: Capture listing title, sector, use class, and site size requirements
4. **Form State Management**: Robust form handling with validation, error states, and data persistence between steps
5. **Protected Route Access**: Authenticated occupiers can access listing creation from protected route (no org_id required)
6. **Auto-Organization Creation**: Automatically create organization from company information during wizard submission
7. **Responsive Design**: Wizard works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
8. **Form Navigation**: Smooth wizard navigation with back/forward controls and step validation

## User Prerequisites

Before development begins, the user must:
1. **UI/UX Design**: Approve wizard flow and visual design mockups
2. **Form Fields**: Validate required form fields and validation rules
3. **User Experience**: Test wizard flow with target users for usability

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Wizard Form Specifications

**Step 1: Company Information**:
```typescript
interface CompanyInfoData {
  companyName: string; // required
  companyDescription?: string; // optional
  contactEmail: string; // pre-filled from auth, read-only
  contactPhone?: string; // optional
}
```

**Step 2: Requirement Details**:
```typescript
interface RequirementDetailsData {
  title: string; // required
  description?: string; // optional
  sector: 'retail' | 'office' | 'industrial' | 'leisure' | 'mixed'; // required
  useClass: string; // required
  siteSizeMin?: number; // square feet
  siteSizeMax?: number; // square feet
}
```

### Component Architecture

```
/occupier/create-listing/page.tsx (protected route)
└── ListingWizard (container)
    ├── WizardProgress (step indicator)
    ├── Step1CompanyInfo
    │   ├── CompanyDetailsForm
    │   └── ContactInfoForm
    └── Step2RequirementDetails
        ├── ListingBasicsForm
        ├── SectorSelection
        └── SizeRangeSlider
```

### Form State Management

```typescript
// Multi-step form state
interface WizardFormData extends CompanyInfoData, RequirementDetailsData {}

// Step management
interface WizardState {
  currentStep: 1 | 2;
  formData: Partial<WizardFormData>;
  isValid: Record<number, boolean>;
  isSubmitting: boolean;
  organizationCreated?: boolean;
}

// Auto-organization creation
interface OrganizationCreationResult {
  success: boolean;
  organizationId?: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Validation Rules

```typescript
const validationSchema = {
  step1: {
    companyName: { required: true, minLength: 2, maxLength: 100 },
    contactEmail: { required: true, email: true },
    contactPhone: { phone: true }
  },
  step2: {
    title: { required: true, minLength: 5, maxLength: 200 },
    sector: { required: true },
    useClass: { required: true, minLength: 2, maxLength: 50 }
  }
};
```

### Auto-Organization Creation Flow

```typescript
// Submission process with auto-organization creation
async function handleWizardSubmission(formData: WizardFormData) {
  // 1. Create organization from company info
  const orgResult = await createOrganizationFromCompanyInfo({
    name: formData.companyName,
    description: formData.companyDescription,
    type: 'occupier'
  });
  
  // 2. Update user with new org_id
  if (orgResult.success) {
    await updateUserOrganization(userId, orgResult.organizationId);
  }
  
  // 3. Create listing with organization context
  return await createListing(formData, userId, orgResult.organizationId);
}
```
