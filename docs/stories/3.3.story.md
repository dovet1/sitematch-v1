- so that I can successfully submit comprehensive property requirements with detailed information for admin approval and go live

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Enhanced End-to-End Integration**: Complete integration of enhanced wizard UI with database API, multi-type file storage, and FAQ system
2. **Comprehensive Data Submission**: Successfully submit complete listing data including enhanced contact fields, multiple file types, locations, and FAQs
3. **FAQ Management System**: Implement accordion-based FAQ creation and management within the wizard
4. **Enhanced Admin Workflow**: Listings created with "pending" status including all new PRD-required fields
5. **Advanced User Feedback**: Clear success/error messaging with enhanced post-submission guidance and confirmation emails
6. **Comprehensive Data Validation**: Complete validation across all enhanced form steps including new required fields
7. **Robust Error Recovery**: Advanced error handling with ability to recover from complex submission failures
8. **Enhanced Post-Submission Flow**: Rich success page with listing summary and clear next steps

## User Prerequisites

Before development begins, the user must complete these setup tasks:

### External Service Configuration
1. **Email Service Setup** (User Action Required):
   - Confirm Resend email service is configured and working (from Story 2.1)
   - Verify email templates exist for listing submission confirmations
   - Provide email sender configuration: `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` environment variable

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Integration Flow

```typescript
// Enhanced complete submission flow with all PRD requirements
async function submitEnhancedListing(formData: EnhancedWizardFormData): Promise<SubmissionResult> {
  try {
    // 1. Upload all file types with progress tracking
    const fileUploads = await uploadAllFiles(formData, (progress) => {
      updateSubmissionProgress(progress * 0.4); // Files are 40% of submission
    });
    
    // 2. Process FAQ data
    const processedFaqs = formData.faqs.map((faq, index) => ({
      question: faq.question,
      answer: faq.answer,
      display_order: index
    }));
    
    // 3. Prepare enhanced listing data with all PRD fields
    const enhancedListingData = {
      // Basic listing info
      title: formData.title,
      description: formData.description,
      sector_id: formData.sectorId,
      use_class_id: formData.useClassId,
      site_size_min: formData.siteSizeMin,
      site_size_max: formData.siteSizeMax,
      
      // Enhanced contact fields (PRD required)
      contact_name: formData.contactName,
      contact_title: formData.contactTitle,
      contact_email: formData.contactEmail,
      contact_phone: formData.contactPhone,
      
      // Company information
      company_name: formData.companyName,
      company_description: formData.companyDescription,
      
      // File URLs
      logo_url: fileUploads.logoUrl,
      brochure_url: fileUploads.brochureUrl,
      
      // Location data with nationwide toggle
      locations: formData.isNationwide ? [] : formData.locations,
      is_nationwide: formData.isNationwide,
      
      // FAQ data
      faqs: processedFaqs,
      
      // Additional files
      site_plan_urls: fileUploads.sitePlanUrls,
      fit_out_urls: fileUploads.fitOutUrls,
      
      status: 'pending'
    };
    
    updateSubmissionProgress(60); // Data preparation complete
    
    // 4. Submit to enhanced API
    const response = await fetch('/api/listings', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(enhancedListingData)
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new Error(errorData.message || `Submission failed: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    updateSubmissionProgress(90); // API call complete
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    // 5. Send confirmation email
    await sendSubmissionConfirmation(formData.contactEmail, result.id);
    
    updateSubmissionProgress(100); // Complete
    
    return { 
      success: true, 
      listingId: result.id,
      message: 'Listing submitted successfully for admin review'
    };
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Enhanced listing submission failed:', error);
    return { 
      success: false, 
      error: error.message,
      type: categorizeError(error)
    };
  }
}

async function uploadAllFiles(formData: EnhancedWizardFormData, onProgress: (progress: number) => void): Promise<FileUploadResults> {
  const results: FileUploadResults = {};
  let completedUploads = 0;
  const totalFiles = countTotalFiles(formData);
  
  // Upload logo
  if (formData.logoFile) {
    results.logoUrl = await uploadFile(formData.logoFile, 'logo', formData.orgId);
    completedUploads++;
    onProgress(completedUploads / totalFiles);
  }
  
  // Upload brochure
  if (formData.brochureFile) {
    results.brochureUrl = await uploadFile(formData.brochureFile, 'brochure', formData.orgId);
    completedUploads++;
    onProgress(completedUploads / totalFiles);
  }
  
  // Upload site plans
  if (formData.sitePlanFiles.length > 0) {
    results.sitePlanUrls = await Promise.all(
      formData.sitePlanFiles.map(async (file) => {
        const url = await uploadFile(file, 'sitePlan', formData.orgId);
        completedUploads++;
        onProgress(completedUploads / totalFiles);
        return url;
      })
    );
  }
  
  // Upload fit-out examples
  if (formData.fitOutFiles.length > 0) {
    results.fitOutUrls = await Promise.all(
      formData.fitOutFiles.map(async (file) => {
        const url = await uploadFile(file, 'fitOut', formData.orgId);
        completedUploads++;
        onProgress(completedUploads / totalFiles);
        return url;
      })
    );
  }
  
  return results;
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

```typescript
interface SubmissionError {
  type: 'validation' | 'network' | 'server' | 'upload';
  message: string;
  field?: string;
  retryable: boolean;
}

function handleSubmissionError(error: SubmissionError): void {
  switch (error.type) {
    case 'validation':
      // Show field-specific error
      setFieldError(error.field, error.message);
      break;
    case 'network':
      // Show retry option
      showRetryDialog(error.message);
      break;
    case 'upload':
      // Handle file upload specific errors
      showFileUploadError(error.message);
      break;
    case 'server':
      // Show general server error
      showServerError(error.message);
      break;
  }
}
```

### Post-Submission States

```typescript
interface SubmissionState {
  status: 'idle' | 'submitting' | 'success' | 'error';
  progress: number; // 0-100
  error?: SubmissionError;
  listingId?: string;
}

// Success page data
interface SubmissionSuccess {
  listingId: string;
  title: string;
  submittedAt: Date;
  estimatedReviewTime: string;
  nextSteps: string[];
}
```

### API Enhancement

```typescript
// Enhanced listings API endpoint
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const data = await request.json();
    
    // Validate complete listing data
    const validation = validateListingData(data);
    if (!validation.valid) {
      return Response.json(
        { error: 'Validation failed', details: validation.errors },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }
    
    // Create listing in transaction
    const result = await createListingWithLocations(data);
    
    // Send confirmation email
    await sendSubmissionConfirmation(data.contact_email, result.id);
    
    return Response.json({
      success: true,
      id: result.id,
      message: 'Listing submitted successfully for review'
    });
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Listing creation failed:', error);
    return Response.json(
      { error: 'Internal server error' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```
