# User Story: Consultant Profile Completion Dashboard Card

## Epic
Platform Enhancement - Professional Services Directory

## Story Title
**As a** consultant user  
**I want** to see a dashboard card that invites me to complete my profile for the agent directory  
**So that** I can opt-in to being featured in the agent directory and gain more visibility for my services

## Background & Context
Currently, consultant users can sign up and select "Consultant" as their user type, but we don't collect the essential profile information needed for a compelling agent directory. Rather than forcing profile completion during signup (which creates friction), we'll use a dashboard card approach that:

1. Reduces signup friction by not requiring immediate profile completion
2. Provides clear value proposition ("Get listed in our agent directory for free")
3. Allows consultants to complete their profile when they're ready and engaged
4. Creates an opt-in system ensuring only motivated consultants appear in the directory

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Dashboard Card Display (Incomplete Profile)
- **Given** I am a logged-in user with user_type = 'Consultant'
- **And** I have NOT completed my consultant profile
- **When** I view my dashboard
- **Then** I should see a prominent card titled "Want to be added to the agent directory for free?"
- **And** the card should include:
  - Clear value proposition text
  - Preview of what the agent directory offers
  - "Complete Your Profile" call-to-action button
  - Estimated completion time (e.g., "Takes 3 minutes")

### AC2: Dashboard Card Styling & Placement
- **Given** I am viewing the consultant profile completion card
- **When** I see the card layout
- **Then** it should be visually prominent but not intrusive
- **And** positioned after existing listing management sections
- **And** use encouraging colors (green/blue) to suggest opportunity
- **And** include relevant icons (directory, profile, visibility)
- **And** be responsive across mobile and desktop

### AC3: Profile Completion Wizard Launch
- **Given** I click "Complete Your Profile" on the dashboard card
- **When** the profile completion flow starts
- **Then** I should be taken to a multi-step wizard
- **And** see a progress indicator showing steps (e.g., "Step 1 of 3")

- **And** I should be able to resume where I left off
- **When** there are validation errors
- **Then** I should see clear error messages
- **And** be prevented from proceeding until fixed
- **When** there are server errors
- **Then** I should see retry options and not lose my data

## Technical Requirements
