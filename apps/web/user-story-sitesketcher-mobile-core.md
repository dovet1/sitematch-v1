## User Story Statement

**As a** commercial real estate professional using SiteSketcher on mobile devices  
**I want** a mobile-optimized interface with proper touch targets, bottom sheet controls, and gesture handling  
**So that** I can efficiently draw and measure site boundaries on my mobile device without UI conflicts or usability issues  

---

## Business Value

- **User Satisfaction**: Improved mobile experience for 60% of users who access the tool via mobile devices
- **Task Completion**: Reduced abandonment rate from current 45% to target 20% on mobile
- **Efficiency**: Decrease average time to complete site sketching from 15 minutes to 8 minutes
- **Support Reduction**: Expected 40% reduction in mobile-related support tickets

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Critical Mobile Improvements

#### AC1: Bottom Sheet Layout Implementation
**GIVEN** I'm using SiteSketcher on a mobile device (viewport < 768px)  
**WHEN** the tool loads  
**THEN** the controls appear in a bottom sheet that:
- Slides up from the bottom with smooth animation (300ms ease-out)
- Has a visible drag handle indicator at the top
- Supports swipe gestures for opening/closing
- Maintains proper z-index above the map but below modals
- Preserves user's last expanded/collapsed state in session

#### AC2: Touch Target Sizing
**GIVEN** I'm interacting with any control element on mobile  
**WHEN** I attempt to tap buttons, inputs, or interactive elements  
**THEN** all touch targets:
- Have a minimum size of 44px Ã— 44px
- Include adequate spacing (minimum 8px) between adjacent targets
- Show visual feedback on touch (background color change or scale effect)
- Are easily reachable with thumb in one-handed operation
- Have increased tap area that extends beyond visual boundaries where needed

#### AC3: Gesture Conflict Resolution
**GIVEN** I'm using SiteSketcher in drawing mode on mobile  
**WHEN** I perform touch gestures on the map  
**THEN** the system:
- Correctly distinguishes between drawing taps and map navigation
- Disables single-finger map panning while in drawing mode
- Allows two-finger pinch/zoom in all modes
- Prevents accidental mode switches during active drawing
- Shows clear visual indicator of current mode (drawing vs navigation)

### Phase 2: Important Mobile Enhancements

#### AC4: Enhanced Visual Feedback
**GIVEN** I'm interacting with SiteSketcher on a touch device  
**WHEN** I perform any touch action  
**THEN** I receive immediate visual feedback:
- Touch point indicator appears at tap location
- Drawing mode shows "Tap to add point" helper text
- Active polygon vertices show highlight on hover/touch
- Completed polygons flash briefly to confirm completion
- Error states (e.g., invalid polygon) show clear visual warning

#### AC5: Simplified Interaction Modes
**GIVEN** I'm using SiteSketcher on mobile  
**WHEN** switching between drawing and selection modes  
**THEN** the interface:
- Provides a prominent mode toggle button (minimum 48px)
- Shows current mode with clear visual distinction (color/icon)
- Automatically exits drawing mode after polygon completion
- Remembers last used mode between sessions
- Reduces mode options to essential two: Draw and Select

#### AC6: Mobile-Specific Controls
**GIVEN** I'm using the mobile interface  
**WHEN** accessing measurement and control features  
**THEN** the controls are optimized for mobile:
- Area measurements display in large, readable text (min 16px)
- Undo/Redo buttons are prominently placed and sized
- Clear all function requires confirmation to prevent accidents
- Polygon list shows as expandable cards rather than table
- All text inputs use appropriate mobile keyboards (numeric for measurements)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Core mobile components needed
interface MobileBottomSheet {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onToggle: () => void;
  height: 'collapsed' | 'expanded';
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

interface TouchOptimizedButton {
  onClick: () => void;
  minSize?: number; // defaults to 44
  hapticFeedback?: boolean;
  visualFeedback?: 'scale' | 'color';
}

interface MobileDrawingControls {
  mode: 'draw' | 'select';
  onModeChange: (mode: 'draw' | 'select') => void;
  showMeasurements: boolean;
}
```

### Mapbox GL JS Integration
```javascript
// Gesture handling for Mapbox
map.on('touchstart', (e) => {
  if (currentMode === 'draw' && e.originalEvent.touches.length === 1) {
    // Handle drawing tap
    e.preventDefault();
    addDrawingPoint(e.lngLat);
  }
});

// Disable map rotation on mobile to prevent conflicts
map.touchZoomRotate.disableRotation();
```

### CSS Requirements
```css
/* Mobile-specific styles */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .touch-target {
    min-width: 44px;
    min-height: 44px;
    padding: 12px;
  }
  
  .bottom-sheet {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    transition: transform 300ms ease-out;
    touch-action: pan-y;
  }
  
  .mode-toggle {
    width: 48px;
    height: 48px;
    border-radius: 24px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  }
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Tests
1. Bottom sheet can be dragged up/down smoothly
2. All buttons meet 44px minimum touch target
3. Drawing mode prevents map panning with single finger
4. Mode switching is reliable and provides feedback
5. Visual feedback appears within 100ms of touch

### Device Testing Matrix
- **iOS**: iPhone SE (375px), iPhone 12/13/14 (390px), iPhone Plus/Max (428px)
- **Android**: Galaxy S21 (384px), Pixel 6 (411px)
- **Browsers**: Safari iOS, Chrome Android, Chrome iOS

### Performance Benchmarks
- Touch response time: < 100ms
- Animation frame rate: 60fps
- Bottom sheet transition: 300ms
- No touch event drops during rapid tapping

2. **Existing Code**: Leverage current Mapbox GL JS setup, add mobile-specific event handlers
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure desktop experience remains unchanged
4. **State Management**: Use existing React context/state patterns for mode management
5. **Testing**: Use React Testing Library with touch event simulation
